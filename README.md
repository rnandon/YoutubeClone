## Installation
This application uses Node.js to run the local server. Clone the repository to the directory of your choice, the run the command `npm install` to import the necessary packages. Once the packages are installed, make sure the backend is running and run the command `npm start` to start the server. This should automatically open a new browser tab to the project. If it does not, navigate to localhost:3000 to view the project.
